The program has four synchronous tasks (named one--, two, three, four) 
that execute for a bit more than 1 second. The execution of entire
program is split into discrete base periods that last for 3 seconds.
In each base period, tasks are give 1 second of execution time after
which they are preempted and a new task is executed. Currently, tasks 
one-- and two are allocated to one hardware thread and tasks three 
and four are allocated to another hardware thread. 

Tasks one--, three, and four have constant release frequencies of 
3 base periods, while task two has a constant release frequencies of 
5 base periods. An example of the outputs produced by the program are 
shown below.
