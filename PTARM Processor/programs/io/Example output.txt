This program has four tasks (named one, two, three, four)
whose execute continues forever. Each task is allocated 
to its own PTARM hardware thread. The program preempts task
one every 1 second, preempts task two every 2 seconds, 
preempts task three every 3 seconds, and preempts task four
every 4 seconds. No UART outputs should be generated by the 
program. Task one relays the switch and key states to the 
red and green LEDs, task two outputs initial bit patterns 
to the LEDs, task three outputs hexidecimals to the 7-segment 
displays, and task four outputs characters to the LCD.
