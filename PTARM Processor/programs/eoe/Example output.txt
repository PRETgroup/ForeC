This program has four tasks (named one, two, three, four)
whose execute continues forever. Each task is allocated 
to its own PTARM hardware thread. The program preempts task
one every 1 second, preempts task two every 2 seconds, 
preempts task three every 3 seconds, and preempts task four
every 4 seconds. An example of the outputs produced by the
program is shown below.
