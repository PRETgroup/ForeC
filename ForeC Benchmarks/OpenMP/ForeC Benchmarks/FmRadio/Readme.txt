Folders:
--------
original: 
  The original C code.
  
pipelined: 
  The original C code modified into ForeC code (FmRadio.forec), using 
  software pipelining to expose parallelism.
  
divideAndConquer:
  The original C code modified into ForeC code (FmRadio.forec), using 
  divide-and-conquer to expose parallelism.


Multi-threaded C programs from the ForeC implementations:
---------------------------------------------------------
The ForeC compiler was developed to target execution on a "bare metal" 
multicore MicroBlaze system. Each ForeC thread is statically mapped to 
an available core by the programmer in a ForeC header file (*.foreh).
From the mapping, the ForeC compiler creates a light-weight static thread 
scheduler for each core.

The ForeC compiler can also target OSes supporting Pthreads, but 
the implementation is naive. The bare metal code generated for a core 
(with a few modifications) is wrapped up in a Pthread. This Pthread 
is then executed by the OS on an underlying core.


Outputs:
--------
The output (FmRadio.raw) generated by the original program is located in 
"/original/".

The diff command can be used to compare the outputs to see if the ForeC 
implementation preserves the functionality of the original C program.
