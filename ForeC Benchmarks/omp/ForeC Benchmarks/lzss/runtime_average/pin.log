Pin 2.12 kit 59761
E: Attach to pid 5128 failed. 
  The Operating System configuration prevents Pin from using the default (parent) injection mode.
  To resolve this, either execute the following (as root):
  $ echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
  Or use the "-injection child" option.
  For more information, regarding child injection, see Injection section in the Pin User Manual.
